# Hi, I'm Ben 👋

Hey there! I’m Ben, a senior web developer at Astro. You might know me from my short whiteboard videos breaking down all sorts of topics (React Server Components, HTMX, and SQLite to name a few). You also might know me as the inventor of Astro. **I didn't invent Astro.** But I'm a proud full time developer driving it forward :)

## Find repositories from my content

You may have seen one of my GitHub repositories featured in a recent video, tweet, blog post, friend flashing their phone in your face, etc. I've labeled these repositories using [topics](https://github.com/topics). You can search my repositories using the syntax `topic:video`, or use one of these quick search links:

- 🎥 [Repo from a video](https://github.com/bholmesdev?tab=repositories&q=topic:video&type=&language=&sort=)
- 🐦 [Repo from a tweet](https://github.com/bholmesdev?tab=repositories&q=topic:twitter&type=&language=&sort=)
- 🔴 [Repo from a livetream](https://github.com/bholmesdev?tab=repositories&q=topic:livestream&type=&language=&sort=)
- 📝 [Repo from a blog post or newsletter](https://github.com/bholmesdev?tab=repositories&q=topic:blog&type=&language=&sort=)
