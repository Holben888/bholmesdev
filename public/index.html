<div class="content" markdown><p>I first got into software development not through algorithms, not unit testing, not objected-oriented principles‚Ä¶ none of the hirable buzzwords. Back in high school, I was wrestling with Java concepts because <em>I love making shiny pixels move around on a screen.</em></p>
<p>Back then, it was in the pursuit of inefficient, spaghetti-coded video games. Now, I've channeled a love for graphics into <em><strong>web development and design</strong></em>. I spent most of my time at Georgia Tech figuring out the sexiest frameworks to use, the most impactful way to apply my novice knowledge, and how to teach others at a beginner's level. I'm just entering the working world as an adult-in-denial, so I hope <a href="https://dev.to/bholmesdev">my lessons learned along the way</a> end up helping you!</p></div>

<li>Learning web dev sucks and I want to help</li>
<li>Co-authored fullstack bootcamp with in-person workshops</li>
<li>Became Top 500 author on DEV.to in 2019</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="content" markdown><p>Let's be honest, picking up web development ain't easy. I spent years banging my head against Codecademy tutorials and W3schools to vertically center a div (and the top Stack Overflow answer is still wrong üòë). What's even worse is how disconnected university CS curricula ends up feeling compared to <em>useful</em> web development concepts.</p>
<p>So, I got tired of sitting in silence. I started a blog back in 2019 as a place to paste some concepts and snippets I learned into a public resource. This somehow made me a Top 500 author on DEV.to (I'll never understand that‚Ä¶), which motivated me to get more involved as a web dev teacher at Georgia Tech. Now, I have <strong><span id="post-count">10</span></strong> posts to my name and an entire curriculum of full stack fundamentals!</p></div>

<div markdown><h3 id="iledabootcamp">I led a bootcamp.</h3>
<p>I asked around the dev community to udnerstand how people learn best, and I found a variety of approaches from written documentation to recorded code-alongs. So, I tried to make a bootcamp that was the best of <em>all</em> worlds, incorporating video activites, written code samples, and in-person workshops to create one <strong>mega resource</strong> for becoming a MERN stack sorcerer üîÆ</p>
<p>We've been teaching this material at the <a href="https://bitsofgood.org">Bits of Good student org</a> for 2 semesters now, so we've had a lot of time to work out the kinks. Click through to find our videos, resources, and project templates 100% free! A huge thanks to Andre Hijouay for creating the incredible v1 of the bootcamp, Max Karpawich for our lovely backend materials, and James Wang for contributing + teaching üòÅ</p></div>
