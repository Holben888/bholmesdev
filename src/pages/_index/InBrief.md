Hey there! I’m Ben, a software dev from Charleston SC, USA, learning how cold the northeast can be. You can call me a “traditional” software developer by trade given my [BS in CS](https://www.gatech.edu/academics/degrees/bachelors/computer-science-bs) from Georgia Tech (go Jackets!). Today, I’ve channeled this technical know-how into open source web development as a full-time maintainer at [Astro](https://astro.build).

My core values are **be caring**, **be clear**, and **be casual.** Tech is a scary industry to jump into, especially without a sense of humor to keep your head on straight. So as long as I’m a web developer, my goal is to <a class="color-orange" href="#teach">**teach**</a> and <a class="color-purple" href="#build">**build**</a> tools that help others become the best version of themselves. Well, assuming we adhere to [semantic versioning principles](https://semver.org/) 😉
