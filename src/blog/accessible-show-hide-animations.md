I've had a fair amount of experience building navigation dropdowns at this point. Heck, I even [wrote an article](https://bholmes.dev/blog/building-a-sexy-mobile-ready-navbar-in-any-web-framework/) on build a navbar in any web framework! But I've quickly discovered some missing pieces in my approach to showing / hiding, well, _anything_ on the page:
- **accessibility for keyboard users** isn't perfect for link or button filled dropdowns (like mobile navigation)
- **the screenreader experience** doesn't announce when new elements are shown on the page at all (a huge problem for the visually impaired)

So I wanted to use this article to explore the **missing accessibility pieces in your show-hide interactions.** This means dropdowns, accordions, on-off switches, sidebars... you name it! Oh, and we'll be sure your sexy CSS transitions stay in the mix.

## Starting with a naive solution
Okay, wait, why isn't this post a 2 minute read? I just whipped up this fade transition in a CodePen and it works great!

_If you don't recognize this meme, [go culture yourself](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nileseyy-niles-disappears)_

I'll admit that a simple `opacity` shift works pretty well for non-interactable elements like this `img`. But what if you're **showing and hiding clickable elements,** like a navigation bar of links?

This can spell problems for those using keyboard navigation or screenreaders. It's (embarrassingly) a problem across some of my own sites that I'm working to fix, but it can be tricky to debug.

Here's an example of hitting the `tab` key through our [Hack4Impact.org](https://hack4impact.org) site. I've adjusted the dropdown overlay to `opacity: 0.1` to show which items are focused, but you can expect the same behavior for `opacity: 0`:

![When hitting toggling the hamburger menu off on the Hack4Impact site, we see a faint focus ring over each link as we tab to these low opacity elements](/assets/blog/show-hide-animation/show-hide-tab-focus-demo.gif)

_Follow either the focus ring around the elements, or the `activeElement` query in the console view (which prints the element being focused)_

Uh oh, I'm still able to focus and select these links! What's more, our `opacity` solution poses a problem for visually impaired users, since they won't know that our visual `opacity` shift _really_ means showing and hiding a dropdown.

What we really want is the best of _all_ worlds:
1. A nifty fade in-and-out animation for sighted users
2. The ability to focus interactable links and buttons _only_ when the element is revealed
3. A callout for screenreaders whenever we show and hide something

## ‚å®Ô∏è Let's accommodate keyboard users
_This section is for showing / hiding interactable elements, like a set of buttons or links_

Focusing on that `tab` key first, we need to find a way to make sure that a not-so-visible element can't be accessed at all.

You might remember a nifty property for this already: `display: none`. This makes element nonexistent in the document, right? 

Well it's worth a shot! Let's toggle to `display: none` when our element is hidden, and add `display` alongside `opacity` in our list of transitions.

We'll be using this basic navigation dropdown as fuel for the rest of our code examples. Nothing fancy on the JS + HTML sides! The important piece are those `.dropdown` and `.dropdown.expanded` selectors in our CSS. That's where we toggle between our `display` states like so:

```css
.dropdown {
	opacity: 0;
	display: none;
}
.dropdown.expanded {
	opacity: 1;
	/* since we're using flexbox in our dropdown */
	display: flex;
	/* to (hopefully) fade from expanded to collapsed in 0.2 seconds */
	transition: opacity 0.2s, display: 0.2s;
}
```

**Full example:**

{% codepen https://codepen.io/bholmesdev/pen/BaWzGpY default-tab=css,result %}

But wait, where's our fade transition? Sorry to say this is the big limitation of the `display` property: **it cannot be used in CSS transitions** ( [full list of animatable CSS properties here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties)) This means, when we toggle off our `expanded` class, it immediately switches to `display: none` (ignoring our `0.2s` transition) before our opacity has time to sexily fade out üò•

What we need is a way to toggle off `display` _only after_ our element fades out of view. And no, we can't use `keyframes` to set up this sequence ([here's the code you were probably about the try](https://gist.github.com/Holben888/45fa3c0c5ea7bf0e2ef74b882a2e2522) üòâ). But fear not! There's a neat property called `visibility` that can do exactly what we want. Just hot swap `display: none` for `visibility: hidden` and update the transition:

{% codepen https://codepen.io/bholmesdev/pen/xxqOQrw default-tab=css,result %}

And _BAM!_ Our fade animation remains in-tact, but we've successfully hidden our element from keyboard-ists üëç

You can click on that CodePen preview above and start hitting `tab` to test our solution. Your focus should immediately jump from the hamburger button to the CodePen zoom controls, instead of trying to focus those invisible links. And once you focus the button, hit `space`, and start `tab`ing through, those links become selectable.

üí° _**Note:** There is 1 subtle difference between `display: none` and `visibility: hidden`. When using the former, an element gets completely removed from the document, so any elements next to it will **shift to take up the space it left behind.** By contrast, `visibility: hidden` just hides the element visually, while **leaving the gap** for where it used to sit. This prevents your website layout from shifting around when you toggle elements on and off._

Okay, so we know what our website looks like... but what does it sound like? ü§î

Well, I'd recommend breaking out a screen reader for this next part! You can reach for the VoiceOver tool if you're running MacOS, but there's also a [screen reader for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn) you can try on any computer.

### Communicating toggle states with `aria-expanded`

Our navigation toggle button is the first issue to address. If you try expanding and collapsing our menu as-is, the screenreader won't read anything _new_ to the user. This is because, well, it's a plain old button at the moment. We need to tell our reader that it's _actually_ an on-off toggle.

We can pull this off by adding an `aria-expanded` attribute to our button. This boolean should call out whether our menu is in the "expanded" or "collapsed" state. Just set the initial state in our HTML:

```html
<!-- collapsed by default -->
<button aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Nav toggle" class="toggle-dropdown">
```

And keep that value up-to-date wherever we're tracking button clicks. Here's a basic version for plain-JS:

```js
const toggle = document.querySelector(".toggle-dropdown");
toggle.addEventListener("click", () => {
  // toggle our CSS class
  dropdown.classList.toggle("expanded");
  // and if our "expanded" class is turned on...
  if (dropdown.classList.contains("expanded")) {
	// set aria-expanded to true
    toggle.setAttribute("aria-expanded", "true");
  } else {
	// otherwise it's false
    toggle.setAttribute("aria-expanded", "false");
  }
});
```

{% codepen https://codepen.io/bholmesdev/pen/vYxKVgB default-tab=js,result %}

![VoiceOver output as we toggle our button. Notice we get a new announcement for every click saying either "expanded" or "collapsed"](/assets/blog/show-hide-animation/aria-expanded-screenreader-demo.gif)

_VoiceOver output as we toggle our button. Notice we get a new announcement for every click saying either "expanded" or "collapsed"_

You can also add the attribute `aria-haspopup="true"` to your button. This will just added the word "popup" to the screenreader output to make behavior just a bit more understandable. Optional, but recommended!

### Focusing our dropdown on expanded

_**Note:** This should only be used when showing / hiding interactable elements. If you're just revealing images or paragraphs, the `aria-expanded` piece should be sufficient!_

So now we're telling the user that they're expanding and collapsing something. But what is this _something_ their actually toggling?

Sadly, there's no straightforward way to tell the user "you just expanded my fancy dropdown!" There _is_ an `aria-controls` attribute you can try, but it's only supported by the premium [JAWS screen reader](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/) (which many users don't have access to).

So, we're going to offer the next best thing: just focus the first element in our dropdown to read out the contents immediately. This means shifting keyboard focus (yes, visually impaired users tend to navigate navigate using a keyboard) from our menu button to our first link whenever `aria-expanded="true"`. Of course, this only applies when revealing interactable elements like buttons or links, so it should

Should be simple enough! Just add a call to `focus()` whenever we expand the element, right?

```js
toggle.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (dropdown.classList.contains("expanded")) {
	// use firstElementChild to grab the first link
	dropdown.firstElementChild.focus()
    toggle.setAttribute("aria-expanded", "true");
  } else {
	  ...
});
```

Well, this doesn't work super reliably when we have our fancy CSS transition. There's a chance we'll try to focus the first link while `visibility` is still `hidden`, which prevents our `focus()` call from going through üòï

Luckily, there's an easy way to "wait" on our CSS transition to finish before setting focus. We just need to listen for the `transitionend` event on our dropdown like so:

```js
dropdown.addEventListener('transitionend', () => {
  if (dropdown.classList.contains("expanded")) {
	// instead of calling focus() in our 'click' listener,
	// we'll call it from here!
    dropdown.firstElementChild.focus()
  }
})
```

With this in place, we should get reliable link focusing with a matching screen reader output üëç

**Finished product**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Applying this to your favorite framework

We've covered a lot of ground using plain JS, but it's quick-and-easy to apply to any component framework!

We just need a couple pieces:
- **an `expanded` state variable** to keep track of showing / hiding
- **a callback to `focus()` our first dropdown element on `transitionend`.** For most frameworks, we can just attach a callback function to an element's `onTransitionEnd` attribute.

### A simple React solution

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

export default function DropdownExample() {
  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);
  const focusFirstDropdownLink = ({ target }) => {
	// if we apply this function to our dropdown,
	// the "target" should be a reference to the dropdown itself!
    target.firstElementChild.focus();
  };
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <button
          className="toggle-dropdown"
          aria-expanded={expanded}
          aria-haspopup="true"
          aria-label="Nav toggle"
          onClick={() => setExpanded(!expanded)}
        >
          ...
        </button>
      </nav>

      <div
		{/*toggle our "expanded" CSS class*/}
        className={expanded ? "dropdown expanded" : "dropdown"}
		{/*trigger our focus() once the dropdown's fade effect finishes*/}
        onTransitionEnd={focusFirstDropdownLink}
      >
        <a href="/">Home</a>
        <a href="/about">About</a>
        <a href="/projects">Projects</a>
        <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

Pretty straightforward rewrite! The ability to bind our `focus()` function to the `onTransitionEnd` listener saves us a lot of work. We don't even need a `useRef` to grab the element, in fact.

Here's a [**working sandbox demo**](https://codesandbox.io/s/accessible-show-hide-react-4rv7m?file=/src/App.js) for you to try üöÄ

### Svelte example
This should be equally trivial in Svelte:

```html
<script>	
	let expanded = false;
	
	const focusFirstDropdownLink = ({ target }) => {
	    // again, "target" should be a reference to our dropdown
		target.firstElementChild.focus()
	}
</script>

<style>
...
</style>

<nav>
	<button class="toggle-dropdown" aria-expanded={expanded} aria-haspopup="true" aria-label="Nav toggle" on:click={() => expanded = !expanded}>
		<svg viewBox="0 0 448 512" width="100" title="bars">
      <path d="M16 132h416c8.837 0 16-7.163 16-16V76c0-8.837-7.163-16-16-16H16C7.163 60 0 67.163 0 76v40c0 8.837 7.163 16 16 16zm0 160h416c8.837 0 16-7.163 16-16v-40c0-8.837-7.163-16-16-16H16c-8.837 0-16 7.163-16 16v40c0 8.837 7.163 16 16 16zm0 160h416c8.837 0 16-7.163 16-16v-40c0-8.837-7.163-16-16-16H16c-8.837 0-16 7.163-16 16v40c0 8.837 7.163 16 16 16z" />
    </svg>
	</button>
</nav>

<!--Note we can use class:expanded to bind our "expanded" CSS class to the "expanded" state variable-->
<div class="dropdown" class:expanded on:transitionend={focusFirstDropdownLink}>
	<a href="/">Home</a>
	<a href="/about">About</a>
	<a href="/projects">Projects</a>
	<a href="/contact">Contact</a>
