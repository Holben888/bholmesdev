I first got into software development not through algorithms, not unit testing, not objected-oriented principles... none of the hirable buzzwords. Back in high school, I was wrestling with Java concepts because _I love making shiny pixels move around on a screen._

Back then, it was in the pursuit of inefficient, spaghetti-coded video games. Now, I've channeled a love for graphics into _**web development and design**_. I spent most of my time at Georgia Tech figuring out the sexiest frameworks to use, the most impactful way to apply my novice knowledge, and how to teach others at a beginner's level. I'm just entering the working world as an adult-in-denial, so I hope [my lessons learned along the way](https://dev.to/bholmesdev) end up helping you!

## I teach.

<p class="in-brief-header">In brief...</p>

- Learning web dev sucks and I want to help
- Co-authored fullstack bootcamp with in-person workshops
- Became Top 500 author on DEV.to in 2019

Let's be honest, picking up web development ain't easy. I spent years banging my head against Codecademy tutorials and W3schools to vertically center a div (and the top Stack Overflow answer is still wrong üòë). What's even worse is how disconnected university CS curricula ends up feeling compared to _useful_ web development concepts.

So, I got tired of sitting in silence. I started a blog back in 2019 as a place to paste some concepts and snippets I learned into a public resource. This somehow made me a Top 500 author on DEV.to (I'll never understand that...), which motivated me to get more involved as a web dev teacher at Georgia Tech. Now, I have **<span id="post-count">10</span>** posts to my name and an entire curriculum of full stack fundamentals!

### I led a bootcamp.

I asked around the dev community to udnerstand how people learn best, and I found a variety of approaches from written documentation to recorded code-alongs. So, I tried to make a bootcamp that was the best of _all_ worlds, incorporating video activites, written code samples, and in-person workshops to create one **mega resource** for becoming a MERN stack sorcerer üîÆ

We've been teaching this material at the [Bits of Good student org](https://bitsofgood.org) for 2 semesters now, so we've had a lot of time to work out the kinks. Click through to find our videos, resources, and project templates 100% free! A huge thanks to Andre Hijouay for creating the incredible v1 of the bootcamp, Max Karpawich for our lovely backend materials, and James Wang for contributing + teaching üòÅ
